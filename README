Guile version 0.001
===================

This module provides an interface to the Gnu Guile system.  You can
find out more about Guile at:

   http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html.

Guile is an interpreter for the Scheme programming language.  "Scheme
is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp
programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay
Sussman."  You can find this quote in the language definition for
Scheme here:

   http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/r5rs_toc.html

This module is being developed in order to support the development and
usage of an Inline::Guile module.  The intention is to allow Perl
programmers to intermix Perl and Guile code in their programs and
modules.


DEPENDENCIES

This module has two rather aggressive requirements:

  1) Perl 5.6.1+

  I'll eventually test against older Perl versions but for now I'm
  only working with the latest and greatest.

  2) Guile 1.5.0+

  At the time of this writing Guile 1.5.0 hasn't even been released
  yet.  You can only get it from CVS.  Details can be found at:

     http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/anon-cvs.html

  I don't think my module will ever work with older Guile versions.


INSTALLATION
