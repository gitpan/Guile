Guile version 0.002
===================

This module provides an interface to the Gnu Guile system.  You can
find out more about Guile at:

   http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html.

Guile is an interpreter for the Scheme programming language.  "Scheme
is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp
programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay
Sussman."  You can find this quote in the language definition for
Scheme here:

   http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/r5rs_toc.html

This module is being developed in order to support the development and
usage of an Inline::Guile module.  The intention is to allow Perl
programmers to intermix Perl and Guile code in their programs and
modules.


DEPENDENCIES

  1) Perl 5.6.1

  Might work with older versions, but don't count on it. Certainly not
  5.005.
